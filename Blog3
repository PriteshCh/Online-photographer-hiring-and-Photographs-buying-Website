                                    How to Photograph Monochrome

                                    Look for Contrast
                                </h2>

                                    Since the best monochrome images are all about tonal contrast, you need to train yourself to look for contrasting tones around you when looking for appropriate scenes or subjects before actually aiming your camera. It may be challenging to try to “see” how a colored scene will look in grayscale or sepia, but it helps to pay attention to the highlights (near whites) and lowlights (near blacks), as well as lines and shapes, to evaluate a potential subject for your frame.

                                    Find or Create a Wider Range of Midtones
                                </h2>
                                <p class = "blog1-text">
                                    While blacks and whites—or highlights and shadows—make interesting monochrome images, they may look a bit dull when some areas don’t have grays. Having a middle tone or a wider dynamic range adds depth and dimension to your black and white or sepia photos. You can do this by using a light source, such as an external flash, to add highlights and shadows over other parts of your photo.
