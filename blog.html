                                    As many photographers struggle to visualise a scene in black and white, these monochrome modes are an invaluable tool that will help with composition and scene assessment.

                                    The most obvious application for lensballs is landscape photography. The fisheye-like scene captured inside the ball lends itself very well to this genre. Although there is certainly skill required to find the correct location to place the ball.
