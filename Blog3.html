                                                1. Shoot against the source of light

                                                The human eye has a much larger dynamic range than the sensor of any camera. Our eyes can easily recognize a person standing against the sunset sky, but when you take a photo of the same portrait, you’ll get something entirely different.

                                                As long as the source of light is located behind your photography subject, the subject stays in shadow and automatically turns into a silhouette when you take a photo. If you shoot outdoors, it’s essential that the sun is relatively low above the horizon, which is why sunsets, sunrises and winter days at higher latitudes are perfect for silhouette photography.
                                                </p>
                        <div class = "single-img">
                                                <h2 class = "blog1-title">
                                                2. Only pay attention to the outline of your subjects
                                                </h2>
                                                <p class = "blog1-text">
                                                When you’re photographing a person’s silhouette, it doesn’t matter what their facial expression is because you’ll only see their outline. On the other hand, the outline itself can make a huge difference, so you must learn to look at your photography subjects in terms of their outline. As you try to make the best possible silhouettes of human subjects, you’ll notice that minor things like the position of their limbs can make a massive difference.

                                                If your subjects are moving, try taking photos in burst mode (which you can activate by holding down the shutter of the iPhone) so you can pick the exact right moment later. Also, avoid overlapping subjects such as people standing in front of each other. Because you can only see their combined outline, overlapping subjects are confusing and generally don’t look good.
